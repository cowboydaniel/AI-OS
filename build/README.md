# Build Directory

This directory houses tooling for generating AetherOS installer media. During Phase 2 it will collect Mint remaster assets such as unpack/repack scripts, preseed or OEM configuration files, and branding hooks. Keep the files here reproducible and scriptable; large binaries belong under `artifacts/iso/` and must be tracked with Git LFS as described in the repository standards.
