# Packages Directory

Package manifests and build scripts for distributing the AI Desktop Shell, AI core services, and supporting utilities live here. Document packaging choices (Flatpak vs `.deb`), dependencies, and build instructions alongside each manifest. Keep package outputs out of Git history; only ship definitions and helper scripts.
